<!--
Folio PR template. Every sprint lands as ONE PR built from docs/sprints/sprint-NN.md.
Fill every section. The most valuable part for the learner is "How to review this PR".
-->

## Context
<!-- What problem/user-need does this sprint address? Link the sprint playbook + issues. -->
Sprint: `docs/sprints/sprint-NN.md`
Closes #<!-- issue --> · Closes #<!-- issue -->

## Approach
<!-- The design in a few sentences. Why this shape and not the obvious alternative. -->

## Screenshots / recording
<!-- [do live] For UI or behavior. A short clip beats paragraphs. -->

## Tradeoffs considered
<!-- What you weighed. Link the planted debate thread + any ADR added this sprint. -->

## Deferred
<!-- What was intentionally left out, each as a linked issue (no orphan TODOs). -->

## Learning objectives
<!-- The 3–5 skills this PR is meant to teach. Pull from the sprint playbook. -->

## How to review this PR
<!-- THE teaching section. Give the exact file reading order so a junior can follow the
     story: schema → API → client → tests → docs. Point out the commits to read as a
     narrative (e.g. the planted-flaw → failing-test → fix arc). -->
